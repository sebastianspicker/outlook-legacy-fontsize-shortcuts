# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version on the default branch is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability") to report issues privately. If you are unable to use advisories, open a minimal issue that does **not** include exploit details and request a private channel.
